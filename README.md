# Farhan Islam • Portfolio v1.0

A premium, high-contrast dark mode portfolio designed for 2026 aesthetics. This project uses React, Tailwind CSS, and modern design principles like glassmorphism and vibrant accent layering.

## 🚀 Recent Updates
- **Smooth Navigation:** Linked the "Let's Talk" CTA in the Hero section directly to the Contact form.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Enabled global smooth scroll behavior for a premium feel.

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap & Recommendations

To elevate this portfolio to a world-class standard, consider the following updates:

### 1. New Pages to Add
- **Case Study Pages (`/project/:id`):** Instead of just a modal or external link, create dedicated pages for each project. Include the "Challenge," "Solution," and "Result."
- **Blog Section (`/blog`):** Essential for SEO. Share insights on web development trends (e.g., "Why 2026 aesthetics favor high-contrast UI").
- **Process Page (`/process`):** A detailed walkthrough of your development lifecycle (Discovery -> Design -> Code -> Launch).
- **404 Custom Page:** A stylish, branded 404 page to keep users engaged if they get lost.

### 2. Technical Enhancements
- **Framer Motion:** Add high-end entrance animations and layout transitions (e.g., stagger effects on the Portfolio grid).
- **Custom Cursor:** A small blue/green trailing cursor adds to the "futuristic tech" vibe.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Even though the brand is dark-focused, an optional high-contrast light mode increases accessibility.
- **Form Handling:** Integrate a service like **Formspree** or **Netlify Forms** into `Contact.tsx` to make the "Send Message" button functional.
- **Lottie Animations:** Use subtle Lottie files for the icons in the Services section to add movement.

### 3. SEO & Performance
- **Image Optimization:** Use `.webp` or `.avif` formats for project thumbnails.
- **Metadata:** Update `metadata.json` with specific keywords like "React Developer," "Freelance Web Dev," and "Next.js Expert."
